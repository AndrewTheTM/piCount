# Arduino Power Board

This is a power board that I've designed to monitor the power consumed by all
this and to move the 12V battery power down to 5V for the RPi.  Yes, some power
is lost to the Arduino and to logging.

This board is designed to be used with an Arduino Uno and a Sparkfun Open Log
board.  It is not expected to be in use for full-time use, although there is
nothing that would keep it from being in full-time use.
